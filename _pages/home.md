I am a Fourth Year B.Tech student majoring in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web) with Minor in [Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in) at [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in). My interests lie broadly in the domains of **Computer architecture, High Performance Computing** and **VLSI system design**. I am also interested in exploring new fields like Compilers, Operating Systems, Information theory and their possible correlation with my current interests.

My bachelor's thesis is with [Prof. Madhav Desai](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/people/faculty/home/madhav), in which we are working on building a end-to-end real-time server based communication link with hardware encryption and compression. I have also worked with [Prof. Sachin Patkar](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/patkar) in his [High-Performance Computing Lab](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~hpc/) at IIT Bombay. In the lab I worked on developing a high-speed Inter-FPGA data transmission protocal based on LVDS technology. I have completed many courses under [Prof. Virendra Singh](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~viren/), like Advanced Topics in Computer Architecture, Processor Design, Foundations of VLSI CAD and have done many projects like designing Superscalar Architecture based microprocessor.
