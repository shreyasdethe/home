1.  **Modular Kitchen** </br>
	Designed a kitchen automation system using Internet of Things and MQTT on a local Raspberry Pi server. The user is provided a web-app in which they can click on the pictures of various cabinets in their kitchen which open/close according to the input. The cabinets are clients and use a NodeMCU module aling with mechanical actuators. The app also displays some sensor data such as weight placed inside a cabinet, data from a gas leak sensor, flood sensor, temperature sensors etc. The app can also alert the user based on the data. This app works locally, which gives the advantage of control retained even when internet is down. The app also supports voice activated Google Assisstant commands.
