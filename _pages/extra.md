1.  **Modular Kitchen** <br/>
	Designed a kitchen automation system using Internet of Things and MQTT on a local Raspberry Pi server. The user is provided a web-app in which they can click on the pictures of various cabinets in their kitchen which open/close according to the input. The cabinets are clients and use a NodeMCU module along with mechanical actuators. The app also displays some sensor data such as weight placed inside a cabinet, data from a gas leak sensor, flood sensor, temperature sensors etc. The app can also alert the user based on the data. This app works locally, which gives the advantage of control retained even when internet is down. The app also supports voice activated Google Assisstant commands.


2.  **I-Hack (Hardware track)** <br/>
	*E-Cell, IIT Bombay* <br/>
	Designed and developed a system which uses an encrypted RFID readable card as the primary health card of any person. It was designed in such a way that only registered doctors could write to information to it such as new prescriptions or tests, registered service providers can only read it such that they can know what the doctor has prescribed, and any general public can read only basic medical data like blood group and allergy information, so that immediate medical attention can be provided. It was developed using the Arduino ecosystem. Our team won the first prize, conducted by E-Cell in alliance with [Micron](https://www.micron.com).


3.  **7<sup>th</sup> Inter-IIT Tech Meet** <br/>
	Achieved third position in both the competitions *PlutoX hackathon* and *TCTD Challenge* in the 7th Inter-IIT Tech Meet held at IIT Bombay
