My research interests broadly lie in **Applied Probability, Learning Theory, Optimization, Game Theory** and **Social Networks**. I am primarily interested in theoretical aspects of problems in these fields and I also like to apply these tools to solve real world problems.


Research Projects:
===
1.  **Strategic Interaction on Networks with Imperfect Substitutability | Master's Thesis** (June '18 - Present) <br/>
    *Guide : [Prof. Ankur Kulkarni](http://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/~ankur/), Systems & Control Department, IIT Bombay* <br/>
    *Introduction*: We study a public goods game on networks with imperfect substitutability, wherein each node is an agent and the action performed is the effort put in the game. The benefit function of each player is dependent on the sum of their own effort and a substitutability factor times the sum of effort of each of their neighbours. The cost is dependent on only one's own effort.
    * Proved that the Nash equilibria of a public goods game on a network are given by suitably scaled solutions to a Linear Complementarity Problem defined using the adjacency matrix of the underlying graph.<br/>
    * Characterized the effort maximizing solutions of public goods game using special structures on the graph which are generalizations of independent sets.<br/>
    * Derived absolute upper bounds for the aggregate effort of any equilibria when the underlying graphs are trees.<br/>
    
2.  **On independent Cliques and Linear Complementarity Problems | Master's Thesis** (June '18 - November '18) <br/>
    *Guide : [Prof. Ankur Kulkarni](http://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/~ankur/), Systems & Control Department, IIT Bombay* <br/>
    *Introduction*: Linear Complementarity Problem (LCP(M,q)) is an optimization problem defined as  "Find x such that x >= 0, y = Mx + q >= 0,  y^Tx =  0". We study the l<sub>1</sub> norm maximizing solutions of LCP(I + dA,-e), where A is the adjacency matrix of a graph, d belongs to the interval (0,\infty) and e is the vector of 1's.
    * Generalized the concept of independent sets to a union of independent cliques and defined solutions of the LCP(I + dA,-e) with support as union of independent cliques as Independent Clique Solutions (ICS).<br/>
    * Derived an algorithm which constructs an ICS of the LCP(I + dA,-e) for suitable d.<br/>
    * Proved that the maximum l<sub>1</sub> norm amongst all the LCP(I + dA,-e) solutions is achieved by an ICS.<br/>
    * For d >= 1, proved that  the maximum weighted l<sub>1</sub> norm is achieved at the characteristic vector of a maximum weighted independent set.<br/>

3.  **Estimation of edge resistances using MCMC** (July '17 - October '17) <br/>
    *Guide : [Prof. Vivek Borkar](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/faculty/homepage/borkar), EE Department, IIT Bombay* <br/>
    *Introduction*: The effective resistance of an edge is the resistance assuming all edges are of resistance 1 unit, which is an important metric in social networks and useful for graph sparsification. We provide a fast (O(nlog(n))) algorithm for estimating edge resistances of a graph.
    * Derived an Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based algorithm in a Probably Approximately Correct(PAC) Learning framework to estimate effective edge resistances of a graph.<br/>
    * Provided the complexity analysis and achieved faster convergent rates than existing MCMC algorithms by using Aldous' and Wilson's Algorithm to generate uniform random spanning trees.<br/>
    * Illustrated using simulations that the estimates give the correct order (ranking) of resistances much faster than the time each estimate takes to converge to the true resistance value.<br/>

4. **Risk Aware Economic Dispatch | Summer Internship** (January '17 - April '17) <br/>
    *Guide : [Prof. Rahul Jain](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~rahuljai/Welcome.html), EE Department, University of Southern California* <br/>
    *Introduction*: Economic dispatch solves the optimal output of electricity generation facilities, to meet the system load, at the lowest possible cost, subject to transmission and operational constraints. We consider the risk averse version of this problem and solve it.
    * Surveyed the literature of Stochastic Programming and algorithms to solve multistage stochastic programs.<br/>
    * Studied various type of Risk Measures applicable to Power Markets and reformulated the economic dispatch problem to make it solvable under the risk aware and stochastic regime.<br/>
    * Simplified the problem involving CVaR risk measure into a risk neutral stochastic program which can be solved using standard algorithms like Stochastic Decomposition.<br/>

5.  **A Reinforcement Learning Algorithm for Restless Bandits** (January '17 - April '17) <br/>
    *Guide : [Prof. Vivek Borkar](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/faculty/homepage/borkar), EE Department, IIT Bombay* <br/>
    *Introduction*: The restless bandit problem is to find optimal policies which choose to keep each bandit active or passive at every time step. They use a heuristic called Whittle Index which gives a threshold based near optimal policy. However, computing the Whittle Index is intractable in general and we provide an algorithm to find it.
    * Proposed and analyzed a two timescale learning algorithm to learn the Whittle index for indexable restless bandits which uses the LSPE(Least Squares Policy Evaluation) and Gradient Descent schemes.<br/>
    * Used Linear Function Approximation and Approximate Dynamic Programming to learn the previously intractable Whittle Index Heuristic to solve the restless bandits problem.<br/>
    * Conducted simulations to test our algorithm in scheduling of web crawlers for ephemeral content.<br/>
