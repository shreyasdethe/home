I am a Senior Undergraduate (Bachelor of Technology, B.Tech) student majoring in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web) at [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in). My interests lie broadly in the domains of **Power Electronic Devices, High Density Power Converters** for **Electric Vehicles**. I am also interested in exploring new fields like Battery Management Systems, Solar Energy Power Converter Systems and their possible correlation with my current interests.

My bachelor's thesis is with [Prof. Anshuman Shukla](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/people/faculty/home/ashukla), in which we are working on building a high power density dual active bridge DC-DC converter. I have also worked with [Prof. Shalabh Gupta](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/shalabh) in his [Communications Lab](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~comlab/index.htm) at IIT Bombay, where we worked on developing an analog front-end receiver for the NavIC satellite system of India. I did an internship with [Boson Motors](https://www.bosonmotors.com/), where we developed a high-frequency charge controller for electric vehicle battery charging using the newer **SiC MOSFETs**, and the corresponding gate driver circuit for it.

For more information about my projects refer [here](https://shreyasdethe.github.io/home/projects). I have attached my CV [here](https://shreyasdethe.github.io/home/cv/). To contact me email at: shreyasdethe9[at]gmail.com.

I am a Fifth Year Dual Degree (B. Tech + M. Tech) student of [Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web) at [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/) with specialization in Communications and Signal Processing. My research interests broadly lie in **Applied Probability, Learning Theory, Optimization, Game Theory** and **Social Networks**. I am primarily interested in theoretical aspects of problems in these fields and I also like to apply these tools to solve real world problems.

My master's thesis is with [Prof. Ankur Kulkarni](http://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/~ankur/) and [Prof. Jayakrishnan Nair](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~jayakrishnan.nair/), where we are exploring the topic of Games on Networks. During my undergraduate years, I have been fortunate to work with [Prof. Vivek Borkar](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/faculty/homepage/borkar) on problems in reinforcement learning, multi-armed bandits and MCMC over graphs. I spent the Summer of 2017 as a research intern at the University of Southern California under the guidance of [Prof. Rahul Jain](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~rahuljai/Welcome.html), where we worked on a risk aware stochastic optimization problem.
