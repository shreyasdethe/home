I am a Fifth Year Dual Degree (B. Tech + M. Tech) student of [Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web) at [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/) with specialization in Communications and Signal Processing. My research interests broadly lie in **Applied Probability, Learning Theory, Optimization, Game Theory** and **Social Networks**. I am primarily interested in theoretical aspects of problems in these fields and I also like to apply these tools to solve real world problems.

My master's thesis is with [Prof. Ankur Kulkarni](http://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/~ankur/) and [Prof. Jayakrishnan Nair](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~jayakrishnan.nair/), where we are exploring the topic of Games on Networks. During my undergraduate years, I have been fortunate to work with [Prof. Vivek Borkar](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/faculty/homepage/borkar) on problems in reinforcement learning, multi-armed bandits and MCMC over graphs. I spent the Summer of 2017 as a research intern at the University of Southern California under the guidance of [Prof. Rahul Jain](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~rahuljai/Welcome.html), where we worked on a risk aware stochastic optimization problem.
