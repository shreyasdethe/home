I am a Senior Undergraduate (Bachelor of Technology, B.Tech) student majoring in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web) at [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in). My interests lie broadly in the domains of **Power Electronic Devices, High Density Power Converters** for **Electric Vehicles**. I am also interested in exploring new fields like Battery Management Systems, Solar Energy Power Converter Systems and their possible correlation with my current interests.

My bachelor's thesis is with [Prof. Anshuman Shukla](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/people/faculty/home/ashukla), in which we are working on building a high power density dual active bridge DC-DC converter. I have also worked with [Prof. Shalabh Gupta](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/shalabh) in his [Communications Lab](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~comlab/index.htm) at IIT Bombay, where we worked on developing an analog front-end receiver for the NavIC satellite system of India. I did an internship with [Boson Motors](https://www.bosonmotors.com/), where we developed a high-frequency charge controller for electric vehicle battery charging using the newer **SiC MOSFETs**, and the corresponding gate driver circuit for it.
