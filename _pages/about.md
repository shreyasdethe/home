I am a Fourth Year B.Tech student majoring in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web) with Minor in [Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in) at [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in). My interests lie broadly in the domains of **Computer architecture, High Performance Computing** and **VLSI system design**. I am also interested in exploring new fields like Compilers, Operating Systems, Information theory and their possible correlation with my current interests.

My bachelor's thesis is with [Prof. Madhav Desai](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/people/faculty/home/madhav), in which we are working on building a end-to-end real-time server based communication link with hardware encryption and compression. I have also worked with [Prof. Sachin Patkar](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/patkar) in his [High-Performance Computing Lab](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~hpc/) at IIT Bombay. In the lab I worked on developing a high-speed Inter-FPGA data transmission protocal based on LVDS technology. I have completed many courses under [Prof. Virendra Singh](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~viren/), like Advanced Topics in Computer Architecture, Processor Design, Foundations of VLSI CAD and have done many projects like designing Superscalar Architecture based microprocessor.

For more information about my project refer [here](https://mohilp1998.github.io/projects/). I have attached my CV [here](https://mohilp1998.github.io/cv/). To contact me email at: mohilp1998[at]gmail.com.

I am a Fifth Year Dual Degree (B. Tech + M. Tech) student of [Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web) at [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/) with specialization in Communications and Signal Processing. My research interests broadly lie in **Applied Probability, Learning Theory, Optimization, Game Theory** and **Social Networks**. I am primarily interested in theoretical aspects of problems in these fields and I also like to apply these tools to solve real world problems.

My master's thesis is with [Prof. Ankur Kulkarni](http://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/~ankur/) and [Prof. Jayakrishnan Nair](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~jayakrishnan.nair/), where we are exploring the topic of Games on Networks. During my undergraduate years, I have been fortunate to work with [Prof. Vivek Borkar](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/faculty/homepage/borkar) on problems in reinforcement learning, multi-armed bandits and MCMC over graphs. I spent the Summer of 2017 as a research intern at the University of Southern California under the guidance of [Prof. Rahul Jain](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~rahuljai/Welcome.html), where we worked on a risk aware stochastic optimization problem.
