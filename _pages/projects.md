1.  **Real-Time Server Based Communication Link** (July '19 - Present) <br/>
    *Guide : [Prof. Madhav Desai](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/people/faculty/home/madhav), EE Department, IIT Bombay* <br/>
    In this project, we are developing an end-to-end communication link. The audio signal is captured using a microphone circuit, which is then digitized and sent to FPGA for hardware encryption and compression. The data is then sent to a PC from where it is transmitted to the client via a server based on MQTT protocol. The received data is then decrypted and decompressed before forwarding it to a speaker circuit. The communication link is real-time and full-duplex operating at a sampling rate of 8kHz.
    
2.  **Inter-FPGA data Transmission using LVDS** (May '18 - July '18) <br/>
    *Guide : [Prof. Sachin Patkar](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/patkar), EE Department, IIT Bombay* <br/>
    We developed a high-speed bidirectional data transmission link between two FPGAs using LVDS (Low Voltage Differential Signalling). The data flow is controlled using a simple request and acknowledgement interface along with FIFOs to store the data. The data transmission link is capable of transmitting at data rates upto 400 Mbps. 
    
3.  **Smart Devices' Data Summarization for Behavioural Insights | Summer Internship** (May '19 - July '19) <br/>
    *Samsung R&D Institute, Bangalore* <br/>
    With the proliferation of IoT enabled devices, there is a huge amount of data being produced by those devices. Processing the data generated by these devices can bring out really insightful behavioural attributes of the users. I worked in Samsung's Smart Devices Team, and we worked on developing new machine learning based algorithms to use data generated by these smart devices to understand and predict user behaviour.


4.  **Superscalar Architecture** (January '19 - April '19) <br/>
    *Guide : [Prof. Virendra Singh](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~viren/), EE Department, IIT Bombay* <br/>
    Designed a 16-bit microprocessor based on a superscalar architecture with fetch width of two Instructions and four different pipelines. The architecture is based on a Turing Complete ISA with 17 Instructions and was successfully verified by simulation using Modelsim.
    
5.  **Multiple Drone Tracking and Localization** (November '17 - December '17) <br/>
    *[Drona Aviation](https://www.dronaaviation.com/), IIT Bombay* <br/>
    In the project, we localized the drones' position using Whycon ROS package and extracted 3D coordinates of multiple drones in real-time with accuracy upto 3cm. These coordinates were later used in a project to automate drone's flight movement based on its past location.

6.  **Data Transmission through Polymer Optical Fiber Link** (January '19 - April '19) <br/>
    *Guide : [Prof. Joseph John](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/jjohn) & [Prof. Kumar Appaiah](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~akumar/), EE Department, IIT Bombay* <br/>
    Polymer Optical Fiber provides a low-cost alternative, with the benefit of the high speed of light, for data transmission. In this project, we developed a module capable of transmitting digital data using Polymer Optical Fiber and a simple LED. We achieved data transmission rates upto 35 Mbps.
    
7.  **Colour Sensor using Phase Sensitive Detection** (March '18 - April '18) <br/>
    *Guide : [Prof. Siddharth Tallur](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/people/faculty/home/stallur), EE Department, IIT Bombay* <br/>
    Commercially available colour sensors require a large number of photodiodes to sense the colour. This project was a research project to test whether color sensing can be done with only three photodiodes corresponding to red, blue and green LEDs. The results from the project show that the colour can be sensed but only for a particular type of surface once it is calibrated for that particular type of surface, as it also depends heavily on the texture of the surface.
    
8.  **Texture Synthesis using Non-Parametric Sampling** (October '18 - November '18) <br/>
    *Guide : [Prof. Ajit Rajwade](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ajitvr/), CSE Department, IIT Bombay* <br/>
    In the project, we implemented a research paper on Texture Synthesis, discussing a novel texture synthesis technique based on the assumption of spatial locality. We successfully implemented and replicated the results shown in the paper using MATLAB.
