### [Approximating &#960;](https://shreyasdethe.github.io/pi) - Nov 28, 2019
A dart is thrown randomly at the board on which a square encircling a circle is drawn. The probability that the dart lands inside the circle is &#960;/4, which is equal to the area of the circle divided by the area of the square. By multiplying the number with 4, we can approximate &#960;. Watch the number displayed get closer to &#960; as the number of darts increases! <br/>

### [Raycasting example](https://shreyasdethe,github.io/raycasting) - Jun 18, 2019
Back in the days when 3D graphics were not possible yet, game developers used a technique called 'Raycasting' which provided a '3D effect' to the game. Raycasting is different than raytracing, and is a lot faster because it requires only 2D computations. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard! Mobile content not supported yet. <br/>

### [Fourier series representation of a square wave](https://shreyasdethe.github.io/pi) - Mar 20, 2019
We know that a square wave consists of infinitely many frequencies which are the odd multiples of the fundamental frequency. This representation shows how a square wave can be generated using sine waves. Increases the order slowly to see the effect! <br/>
