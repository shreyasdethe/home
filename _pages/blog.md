### [Boids](https://shreyasdethe.github.io/boids) - May 06, 2020
The boids algorithm, as proposed by Craig Reynolds in 1968, is an algorithm to simulate in computer graphics the flocking behaviour of birds and some fish. There are three essential behaviours - Separation, Alignment and Cohesion. Watch the boids do all of these and click on the screen to change position. <br/>

### [Smart Rockets](https://shreyasdethe.github.io/smart-rockets) - May 01, 2020
In this simulation of evolution, the rockets try to reach the goal (here, coloured red). An example of the Genetic Algorithm, the rockets here start out randomly flailing around, some reaching close to the goal, some not. The next generation of rockets is produced from the fittest rockets in the previous generation, by crossing over their DNA, which is the path taken by them. Watch the rockets learn slowly as generations go down. Creating during the lockdown due to the Novel Coronavirus pandemic!<br/>

### [Approximating &#960;](https://shreyasdethe.github.io/pi) - Nov 28, 2019
A dart is thrown randomly at the board on which a circle inscribed in a square is drawn. The probability that the dart lands inside the circle is &#960;/4, which is equal to the area of the circle divided by the area of the square. By multiplying the number with 4, we can approximate &#960;. Watch the number displayed get closer to &#960; as the number of darts increases! <br/>

### [Raycasting example](https://shreyasdethe,github.io/raycasting) - Jun 18, 2019
Back in the days when 3D graphics were not possible yet, game developers used a technique called 'Raycasting' which provided a '3D effect' to the game. Raycasting is different than raytracing, and is a lot faster because it requires only 2D computations. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard! Mobile content not supported yet. <br/>

### [Fourier series representation of a square wave](https://shreyasdethe.github.io/fourierseries) - Mar 20, 2019
We know that a square wave consists of infinitely many frequencies which are the odd multiples of the fundamental frequency. This representation shows how a square wave can be generated using sine waves. Increase the order slowly to see the effect! <br/>
